# MyWorld
Climate change is real, but often, we are too intimidated by such a large problem that we are paralyzed in our fight against it.
MyWorld works by calculating the carbon cost of your credit card transactions using Mastercard's open-source Carbon Calculator API, allowing you to see firsthand how your actions are affecting the environment.
In an effort to help individuals not only see but improve their footprint, MyWorld offers a feed of alternative, more eco-friendly products and services to users.
Level up as you become greener and compete with friends to see who can make the biggest improvement to their lifestyle!
            MyWorld is an app designed and built by Anish Palakurthi.
